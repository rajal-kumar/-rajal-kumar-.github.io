            <h5 id="t3_p"> When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response? </h5>
              <p id="ref_t3">
                  • I feel like its at times where I don't know which types of code goes where or when there are errors. Sometimes they can be easy errors to spot but other times it can take long.

            <h5 id="t3_p"> How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)? </h5>
              <p id="ref_t3">
                  • By stopping and breating it made a huge difference for me. It gave me a chance to stop and pause, at the same time it let me notice what was going on that caused me to get blocked. So far looking over these its clear that taking a step back doesn't mean your going backwards but it just means that you get a chance to look back and access everything. This then brings us to reflect, pretty much as I said before it is stepping back and looking over everything you've done so far. You might pick up on things you didn't spot earlier on as well.
