        <h4>My Reflections</h4>



      <div class="paragraph">
        <!-- Paragraph 1. -->
        <ul>
            <li><b>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</b></li>
        </ul>
            <p>
                Ever since I have started EDA, I feel like my attitude towards learning has gone from negative to positive. My dedication to study in order to sink in and understand the most I can is an exciting challenge.
            </p>


        <!-- Paragraph 2. -->
        <ul>
            <li><b>What are your impressions?</b></li>
        </ul>
            <p>
                The culture of the EDA campus is a welcoming, friendly environment, while at the same time everyone has their own goals and makes sure they maintain their own focus to progress through their tasks. After finishing at Victoria University the style of learning is a day and night difference. It allows stuents from all sorts of backgrounds, whether its career wise or prior education wise to step out of their comfort zones and collaborate. What I found was that in my previous studying options we weren't allowed to help each other (Teamwork wise) as much as EDA. I personally feel like if you don't apply and share knowledge you won't really get much back in return.
            </p>


        <!-- Paragraph 3. -->
        <ul>
            <li><b>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</b></li>
        </ul>
            <p>
                I am yet to have met many of the others in my Cohort, but I really forward to meeting them. Everyone holds a different background and learning ability and together we can push each other to stay motived, focused and knock down the tasks one by one while learning a set of skills which will open up our future career as Web Developers.
            </p>


        <!-- Paragraph 4. -->
        <ul>
            <li><b>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</b></li>
        </ul>
            <p>
                No. Now that the bootcamp has commenced, I expect myself to be applying myself a lot more. After one week of doing Phase - 0, I can't wait to get deper into the content which EDA has compiled for us.
            </p>


        <!-- Paragraph 5. -->
        <ul>
            <li><b>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</b></li>
        </ul>
            <p>
              I am really excited to start the participation for this sort of environment. I have always been a nervous person, especially when it comes to working in groups for learning. I always feel like that I might ask something stupid etc. But everyone here at EDA and in my Cohort are supportive and take their time to understand what I'm asking and breaks down my issues with me.
            </p>
