            <h5 id="t3_p"> How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens? </h5>
                  <p id="ref_t3">
                      <br>
                      • Pleasure: This is where you enbrace the positivity of life. You are able to maintain a state that is considered a high, in most circumstances this is a rare state to accomdate naturally.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                      • Passion: This is another form of enjoyment, something that you have a pleasure doing that enhances your attitude and skills towards whatever it is. You will notice that time and other factors may go past fast when you are doing something that you have a passion for.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                      • Purpose: A purpose holds meaning behind it, sometimes we may know it sometimes we may not. There are times when the purposes of somthing occures for a rare instance. There are many purposes within and of live, which I have yet to understand I find this a really interesting topic since it could take over a lifetime to figure purses of life aspects out.

                <h5 id="t3_p"> How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise? </h5>
                  <p id="ref_t3">
                      • I found it quite refreshing, one in particular was the inner calm. I found it good just vibing out and slowing everything down in your mind to regather everything. It made me feel relaxed for when I would go back to doing whatever I was in the middle of.
