        <div class="paragraph">
          <!-- Paragraph 1. -->
          <ul>
              <li>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</li>
          </ul>
              <p>
                  I found that Emotional intelligence something that be trained into your thinking/lifestyle. The way of coming around to this is to develop a understanding of where you wish to direct your attention and train your Emotional Intelligence towards it. The Mindfulness part is when your mind deepens and calms down your mind in order to ensure clarity. The reason why I saw so much value for these two aspects was that I understood that, once I had work on these two aspects I will be one step closer to <i><b>"optimizing"</b></i> myself.
              </p>

          <!-- Paragraph 2. -->
          <ul>
              <li>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</li>
          </ul>
              <p>
                  At first it was diffiult for me, as I find myself/my mind trying to focus on everything at once. But once I slowed down my thoughts and had slowly built an understanding, I found this process quite calming.
