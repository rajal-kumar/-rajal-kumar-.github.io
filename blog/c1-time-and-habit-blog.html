          <h4>Time and Habits</h4>

          <!-- Paragraph 1. -->
          <ul>
              <li>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</li>
          </ul>
      <p>
          I used the Pomodoro technique, I had used similar techniques in the past. This technique is one of my favourites, because it allows you to work hard but at the same time gives you regular breaks nd times to freshen up.
      </p>

          <!-- Paragraph 2. -->
          <ul>
              <li>what did you find interesting?</li>
          </ul>
      <p>
          I had found the Mediation quite interesting.
      </p>

          <!-- Paragraph 3. -->
          <ul>
              <li>what worked for you?</li>
          </ul>
      <p>
          The Pomodoro technique worked best for me. This is because it allows you to take short breaks in between to keep your mind fresh and allow you to keep concetrating.
      </p>

          <!-- Paragraph 4. -->
          <ul>
              <li>which will you experiment further with?</li>
          </ul>
      <p>
          I will further experiment with the Mediation, I would like to use this technique more.
