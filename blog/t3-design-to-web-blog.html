            <h5 id="t3_p"><b>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important?</b></h5>
              <p id="ref_t3">
                  • A responsive webstie is when the pages are able to adapt to any screen size, making it easier to use on mobile, tablet and desktop views. Ideally the design will adapt to any device the content is viewed on and the pages will always be available.<br><br>
                  • There are a few reasons why its best to have a responsive website, especially in this time and age:
                    <ul id="response_li">
                        <li>A responsive website saves time by loading faster - saves valueable time.</li>
                        <li>Google has stated 40% of people abandon websites if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load.</li>
                        <li>According to Google 60 - 67% of people will stay on your website and even buy something if the website is responsive.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h5 id="t3_p">What mobile first design is, and why it's important?</h5>
              <p id="ref_t3">
                  • The concept is as simple as it sounds, the hard part is the implementation of this.<br> To put it in a simple way the mobile first approach is: To design for a smaller screens first, then you add more features and content for bigger and bigger screens. This was outlined by <i>Luke Wroblewski, 2009.</i>

              <p id="ref_t3">
                  • A framework is a set files for HTML/CSS/JavaScript, which allow your website to run simply, consistently and responsively. Right now three of the frameworks in demnand are Bootstrap from Twitter, Foundation from Zurb's and YUI from Yahoo. Also lets not forget Skeleton!

            <h5 id="t3_p">What a wireframe is and why we use it?</h5>
              <p id="ref_t3">
                  • A wireframe is also known as a page schematic or screen blueprint. This is used as a blueprint/visual guide that will show you a guidline of the website frame and structure. The reason why we have wireframes is so that we can arrange the elements and contents to see what best suits, before we make the implementations.<br>
                    The wireframe is a sketch up of a website so it lacks many of the main content. These are suchs as colour and graphics, since the main onbjective is to focus on the functionality, behaviour, and priority of the content.

            <h5 id="t3_p"> The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why</h5>
              <p id="ref_t3">
                  • One of the main things that have been difficult for me the CSS parts. I haven't really put much focus on CSS previously, because I had styled through HTML back at university. Now I see how CSS makes everything a whole lot easier but at the same time if you don't know what you are doing it takes a bit of time as well. This is mainly for getting the right positionings etc.
