            <h5 id="t3_p"> What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it? </h5>
              <p id="ref_t3">
                  • Personally for me within a heated conversation it can go two ways, either I will find it really interesting and listen to every word and process it in my head. Or it can go down the other way which will result in me listening and finding wrong points and either butting in and trying to correct the person or bring up my own opinion. Although I to hate it when someone cuts me off. A big learning point for me has been to be quiet, appriciate, interpret and then deliver, if I haven't already.<br>
                  • At first the other person to would get really annoyed or do the same as me. But over time after we both took a step back and realise in order to make this conversation work, we both took each other in to cosideration and built on top of the respect we already held.

            <h5 id="t3_p"> Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice? </h5>
              <p id="ref_t3">
                  • Doing less than what I can is one that really stood out for me. Currently for the last two weeks I have played the catch up game, this isn't a big problem although the problem can be me. I tend to have a habit where I will not budge to carry on until I feel like I have mastered something. In terms of this week, I worked through the Codecademy at my own pace and then went rushing into the Free Code Camp materials. Now if I had taken a step back and reflected over my notes already made, I could have gone through and finished making my blogs before continuing my learning. This was a mistake which has had me a day behind my schedule. From now on pacing myself will be more important and also instead of holding the mindframe of "I want to complete so and so", I will set my self with fewer tasks and see how I am timewise from there.
