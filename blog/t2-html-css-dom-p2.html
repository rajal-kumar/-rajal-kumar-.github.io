      <ul>
          <li><b>What is grid based design?</b></li>
      </ul>
          <p>
              A grid based design is a way you can create a basic structure, or more formally known a skeleton for your design. The grid design has <i>"invisible"</i> lines where your design can be placed. By doing this is combines your overall design together for your <i>"system"</i>, this will support your composition rationally.

      <!-- Paragraph 2. -->
      <ul>
          <li><b>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</b></li>
      </ul>
          <p>
              There is a increasing amount of users whos now access websites through the uses of their smartphones and tablets. This gives the cause for web designers to scramble around for the creation of web designs to fit iPhones, Blackberry, iPad, netbooks and small computers. The reason for this is so that web designs will be able to adjust for different designs and their screen resolutions.

      <!-- Paragraph 3. -->
      <ul>
          <li><b>What is semantic structure?</b></li>
      </ul>
          <p>
              Semantic structure is used quite a bit in HTML to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather merely to define its presentation or look. Semantic HTML is processed by traditional web browsers as well as by many other user agents.
