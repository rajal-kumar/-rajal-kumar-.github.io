            <h5 id="t3_p">  How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS? </h5>
              <p id="ref_t3">
                  • In order to know how these languages are compared, you must first understand how they work together.<br>
                    Web pages that we view on a rugular basis is a build up of structure (HTML), style (CSS) and interaction (JavaScript).<br><br>
                    <img src="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/progressive-enhancement.png" id="grid">
                  <ul class="content-1">
                      <li>HTML - This is a markup language, it represents different of structural data types. For example in HTML we have paragraphs, blocks, lists, images, tables, forms, comments and so on. </li>
                      <li>CSS - Tells our browser how the elements from HTML should be displayed. These displays have the possibility of varying through out different displays.</li>
                      <li>JavaScript - Is able to tell our browser how to respond towards different events that are to happen. This can be events such as clicking on something with an outcome for the actions and so on.</li>
                  </ul>

            <h5 id="t3_p">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h5>
              <p id="ref_t3">
                  • To explain this I will first break down what a "control flow", "if/else statement" is and also what "loops" are and the different types, then I will relate it to the example.<br>
                  <ul class="content-1">
                      <li>Control flow - This is when you are making decisions with you code, in some ways you can think of it as a decision tree. An example of what I mean is, we would have to program a way to select a plot we would like to persue. Therefore Control flow allows JavaScript to make decisions based on the decisions by inputting code based on the condition.</li>
                      <li>If/else statement - "If" statement is used to specify a block of JavaScript code that is to be executed to be true.<br> "Else" statement is used to pecify if a condition to be executed is false.</li>
                      <li>Loops - Loops let us tell the computer to loop over a block of code, so that we don't have to write it over and over again.</li>
                          <ul class="loop-content">
                              <li>For loops - Lets us loop a block of code a known amount of times.</li>
                              <li>While loops - Lets us loop a block of code an unknown amount of times</li>
                              <li>An example of if/else statements:<br>
                                                  Var needCoffee = true;<br>
                                                	If (needCoffee) {<br>
                                                	    console.log('Finding Coffee');<br>
                                                	} else {<br>
                                                	   console.log('Keep on keeping on!');<br>
                                                } </li>
                          </ul>
                  </ul>
              </p>
              <br>
              <p id="ref_t3">
                  • In terms of waking up, that is a decision I make every day when I get up out of bed. Then my dayis followed by if and else statements, I will make decisions that I will repeat through out the day a known amount of times. I brush my teeth twice a day once in the morning and once in the night before I sleep, this will be a For loop. Now things that I won't be able to keep track of will be how many steps I will take, I would class that as a While loop since the amount will be unknown.

            <h5 id="t3_p"> Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects. </h5>
              <p id="ref_t3">
                  <ul class="content-1">
                      <li>What is an object? An object is a collection of properties. Each property is either a data property or an accessor property.</li>
                      <li>What is an Array? Arrays is a way for JavaScript to make lists. The lists can store different data types and JavaScript will order them. This means that the lists will be numbered accordingly by JavaScript.</li>
                  </ul>
              </p>
              <p id="ref_t3">
                  • Arrays are actually considered as an Object itself as everything in JavaScript is an Object. Therefore an Array inherits all its features from an Object. The point of an Array is to store multiple items of the <i>same kind</i>. Another thing feature of the Array is that its starts off from a zero based index, where the method is interacting to a collection of data. An Object, which we have already identified everything in JavaScript is an Object is a representation of the whole thing. In other words Objects can be used as a generic data storage, the only thing is it will not include the standard 0 start like Arrays.

            <h5 id="t3_p">  Explain what functions are and why they are useful. </h5>
              <p id="ref_t3">
                  • <i>"Functions are like recipes"</i>, it is a block of code designed to perform a task. The Function takes data or variables, performs a set of tasks and returns the result. One of the glories of functions is that they allow us to write a chunk of code all at once, then we are able to reuse the code over and over again without rewriting it.
