            <h5 id="t3_p"> What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness? </h5>
              <p id="ref_t3">
                  • Self awareness and mindfulness enable us to be a self dependent and confidently and morally able to control our actions.

            <h5 id="t3_p"> Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel? </h5>
              <p id="ref_t3">
                  • I found that Body scan was something I would prefer. This is because it requires a bit of a pause so you take some time to get a feel of what your body is trying to indicate to you, through senses. I feel like getting a physical feel is good so you know what will help in order to overcome that hold back.
              </p>

            <h5 id="t3_p"> What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section? </h5>
              <p id="ref_t3">
                  • That there is a difference between verbal and physcial/mental emotions. When you are saying something with emotion,then that is only related to the tone you are saying it in not what you feel. When you feel emotion then it can affect you either in a positive way in all aspects of you, or in a negative and sometimes even somewhere in between.
