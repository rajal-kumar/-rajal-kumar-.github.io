            <h5 id="t3_p"> Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go? </h5>
              <p id="ref_t3">
                  • Trust can be the easiest aspect to give into or it can be the hardest thing to give. For me growing up it was hard for me to sit down and listen to something if I could pick up if what was being said wasn't true or genuine. As I grew up I learn't to open my mind adjust and listen, becauseit can be one the greatest factors and first step towards building trust. Regardless of which way its going. Then it comes to asessing the situation by putting questions downs, and then giving back your thoughts in other words feedback. I have had many run ins with trust issues from both ends, but now I'm  at a stage in my life where I can look at these factors of life from a different pospective.

            <h5 id="t3_p"> Try empathic listening - how did it go? </h5>
              <p id="ref_t3">
                  • The way I look at things are in the way that feelings are another sense like sound. Theres many ways of approaching the way you can listen to feelings, a lot of times when listening to them from another person you must asess which state they are in at the time when they are telling you. For example knowing if the other person is in a happy or sad mood, then you respond to what they say in a way that can relate to the mood. This allows you to enter a state of a mindful conversation then you continue from there. This is how I look at it.

When in the state of meditation, where you apply yourself to build yourself with positivty will give you afeeling where love and kindness is being flowed from within you towards people and things around you.

                1. “Maintain rich personal networks within your organization, especially with allies, mentors, and groups who will support and challenge you. To do this, care about people, help people, and nurture relationships. Pay attention to one-on-one relationships, as well as relationships with key groups—your team, other management teams, customers, stakeholders, etc."<br><br>
                2. “Practice reading the underlying currents of your organization. Understand how decisions are made. Are decisions made by authority or consensus? Who are most influential in making them?”<br><br>
                3. “Distinguish between your own self-interest, the interest of your team, and the organization’s interest—everyone has all three of these interests. It is very important to understand which is which.”<br><br>
                4. “Utilize your self-awareness to better understand your role in the web of personalities and interactions. Make frequent use of empathic listening to understand how people feel about situations and about each other.”<br><br>
